	List of classes that have an overwritten rate.
	Note that the lowest rate will be chosen if something has two classes that are both overwritten.
		If you want a different effect, it is best to make a new class
	
	
Example of someone who can't gather from a quarry, but from trees faster and farms slower

Example of someone who can only gather from a Farm. Note that if a tech research can allow them to gather from all wood
	sources later in the game, the system should be able to change if the tech upgrade sets "Wood - 1.0"
GatherRateBase
	Food - 0.0
	Wood - 0.0
	Stone - 0.0
	Alloy - 0.0
GatherRateOverwrite

This means that gather classes are only 2 levels deep. The first level describes the type of resource and the second describes the actual entity.
